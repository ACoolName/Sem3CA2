	<p style="margin-right: 50px;">The goal of this CA was to create a web-site which
           is capable of serving a Business Academy needs for keeping information for
           people in the Academy. They are also assigned different roles like Student or Teacher.
           As additional goals courses and class rooms with time blocks should be added. The system
           must also know about the relations between the different "entities". Besides the web-site
           as a front-end, it must use REST which calls JPA internally. The database used must be
           Oracle. </p>
